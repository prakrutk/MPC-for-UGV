# Step 1: Setup PyBullet Environment
physicsClient = p.connect(p.GUI)
p.setGravity(0, 0, -9.81)
p.setTimeStep(1.0 / 240.0)

# Load or create the robot model in the PyBullet environment
# robot_id 

# Step 2: Define the MPC Controller
def mpc_controller(current_state, goal_state):
    # Implement your MPC controller here
    # Generate control inputs based on current state and goal

# Step 3: Define Robot's Dynamics
# Define the robot's motion equations, constraints, and physics

# Step 4: Define the Cost Function
def cost_function(state_error, control_input):
    # Implement your cost function here
    # Consider state error, control effort, and other factors

# Step 5: MPC Optimization
def mpc_optimization():
    # Implement the MPC optimization algorithm here
    # Solve for control inputs over a finite time horizon

# Step 6: Simulation Loop
while True:
    # Measure the current state of the robot
    current_state = p.getRobotState(robot_id)  # Replace with the appropriate function

    # Define the desired goal state
    goal_state = [desired_position, desired_orientation]  # Customize as needed

    # Use MPC controller to generate control inputs
    control_input = mpc_controller(current_state, goal_state)

    # Apply control inputs to the robot in PyBullet
    p.setJointMotorControlArray(robot_id, jointIndices, controlMode=p.VELOCITY_CONTROL, targetVelocities=control_input)

    # Step the simulation forward in time
    p.stepSimulation()

    # Repeat or exit based on termination conditions

# Step 7: Visualization (Implement as needed)
# Visualize robot trajectory, control inputs, and simulation

# Step 8: Parameter Tuning (Tune parameters for your specific robot and task)

# Step 9: Safety Mechanisms (Implement collision handling and safety measures)

# Step 10: Testing and Validation
# Test the MPC controller under various scenarios and validate its performance

# Close the PyBullet environment when done
p.disconnect()
